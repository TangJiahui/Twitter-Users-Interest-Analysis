"4809","I'd go Torrey. Not sure what Palmer is ready for. MT @JohnVenus543 Torrey or Floyd? #AskFFL","sports"
"4810","@shockraider A weak vote to Antone Smith. I wish they'd give him a legitimate shot to shine. #AskFFL","sports"

"4812","Miller, even with Moreno back. Want to see it from Storm first. MT @CharlieKane_ Storm Johnson or Lamar Miller? #AskFFL","sports"
"4813","Sankey has been bait-and-switch all year, but with Greene out, I use him anyway. MT @tamu2125 Sankey or Wright? #AskFFL","sports"
"4814","Shade to Asiata because he'll get cheap chances to score, likely. I do like Quick too, to be clear. MT @JM1zero Asiata or Quick? #AskFFL","sports"

"4821","I'd gamble with Reed, breaking usual injury rules. I have no faith in Martin. MT @witzer56 Martin or Jordan Reed? #AskFFL","sports"
"4822","I'm going Romo. I expect Buffalo to exploit NE's O-line. Seattle tricky draw, but Romo has playmakers. MT @GeneralSalty Romo/Brady? #AskFFL","sports"
"4823","Generally I don't play anyone off major injury unless forced. So, I go Morris. MT @_ANTH0NY Morris or Moreno? #AskFFL","sports"
